# SpoddyCoiner Policy

These are true statements about the SpoddyCoiner Google Sheets Addon (source code published at https://github.com/SpoddyCoder/SpoddyCoiner)

* It uses the CoinMarketCap API to *fetch* data only.
    * When you sign up for and use a CoinMarketCap API Key, you are agreeing to their terms + policies.
    * https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/user-agreement-personal/
* It does not *push* data anywhere. At any time. Nor will it. Ever.
    * That's worth repeating! 
    * Absolutely none of your data is ever pushed, delivered, sent or otherwise made available to any person, system, entity, anywhere in this world or any other. 
    * And this will always be the case for all future versions of this software.
* It stores preference data and cache data in your own Google Sheets "Properties" object.
    * This is completely private to you.
