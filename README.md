# SpoddyCoiner

Google Sheets Addon that gets data from the CoinMarketCap API - supports all your marginal crypto/coins/tokens/shitcoins/shillcoins/moonshots/deepddhonies. 

This Addon works 100% with *FREE* CoinMarketCap API accounts. Caches the response to help reduce the number of API calls and keep within your rate-limits, great for free CMC accounts which have the lowest rate-limits :)


## Custom Functions

These work just like any standard function in a cell...

* `SPODDYCOINER` - get latest coin prices, market cap, trading volume, token supply, FCAS grades & all sorts of other metadata
* `SPODDYCOINER_CONVERT` - convert an amount between two coins or currencies

### Notes

* All prices/quotes/conversions use CoinMarketCap latest market rates.
* Currently all SpoddyCoiner functions / attributes are available to *FREE* CoinMarketCap API accounts
    * We may support the premium CoinMarket API methods in later releases
