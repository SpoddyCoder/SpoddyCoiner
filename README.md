SpodyCoiner pulls data only, it does not push data anywhwere, at any time. And it never will. Ever. See `POLICY.md` for further info.


## Custom Functions

These work just like any standard function in Google Sheets...

* `=SPODDYCOINER(coin, [attribute], [fiat])`
    * Get latest coin prices / data / metadata about `coin`
    * Default `attribute` is "price". See below for full list of supported attributes.
    * Some attribues (such as "price" or "market_cap") will be returned in `fiat` value
    * Default `fiat` currency can be set in the Addons -> SpoddyCoiner menu

* `=SPODDYCOINER_CONVERT(coin, amount, coin)`
    * Convert an `amount` from one `coin` to another
    * `coin` can also be a currency code

(all prices/quotes/conversions use CoinMarketCap latest market rates)

### About the API Cache

The API cache is your friend :) It stops API calls being repeated unecessarily, helping to keep inside your rate-limit. Free CoinMarketCap API accounts have the lowest rate-limits, but you may purchase a higher tier to increase this.

* Default cache time is 1 hour - the data you see may be up to 1 hour old
* Cache time can be changed in the Addons -> SpoddyCoiner menu, the maximum is 6 hours (21600 seconds)
* Cache can be cleared at any time in the Addons -> SpoddyCoiner menu
