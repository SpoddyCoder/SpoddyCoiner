SpodyCoiner pulls data only, it does not push data anywhwere, at any time. And it never will. Ever. See [a relative link](POLICY.md) for further info.


## Custom Functions

These work just like any standard function in Sheets...

* `=SPODDYCOINER(coin, [attribute], [fiat])`
    * Get latest coin prices / data / metadata about `coin`
    * Default `attribute` is "price". See below for full list of supported attributes.
    * Some attribues (such as "price" or "market_cap") will be returned in `fiat` currency
    * Default `fiat` currency can be set in the Addons -> SpoddyCoiner menu

* `=SPODDYCOINER_CONVERT(coin, amount, coin)`
    * Convert an `amount` from one `coin` to another
    * `coin` can also be a currency code

(all prices/quotes/conversions use CoinMarketCap latest market rates)

### Tools

The SpoddyCoiner Addon menu has a number of useful tools...

* `Refresh Selected Cells`
    * Refreshes the `SPODDYCOINER` functions in the selected cells
    * Super useful if you hit an API rate limit error, simply wait a minute and refresh the cell(s)
* `Refresh All Functions`
    * Much like above but does a refresh of `SPODDYCOINER` functions across the whole spreadsheet
* `Convert Cells to Values`
    * Converts the selected cells to the raw value if they contain a `SPODDYCOINR` function
    * Useful for cells containing coin attributes that are not expected to change (eg: `max_supply`, `year_added` etc.)
    * The value will obviously never update again, but this will save you API calls

        
### Errors

* Error messages from the CoinMarketCap API are shown in the cell
    * This can be turned off in the preferences
    * `symbol` is interchangeable for `coin` in error messages
* Common errors:
    * `Exceeded rate limit`
        * CoinMarketCap API rate limits are relatively low on their free-tier accounts
        * You can purchase a higher tier to increase rate-limits
        * Rate-limits are reset every minute
        * See the Addon -> SpoddyCoiner -> Tools menu for a handy way to refresh the `SPODDYCOINER` functions
    * `Invalid value for symbol` or `symbol is not allowed to be empty`
        * The coin ticker/symbol you've entered is not correct
        * If you're using a cell reference, check it's accurate.


### About the API Cache

The API cache is your friend :) It stops API calls being repeated unecessarily, helping to keep inside your rate-limit. 
Free CoinMarketCap API accounts have the lowest rate-limits, but you may purchase a higher tier to increase this.

* Default cache time is 1 hour - the data you see may be up to 1 hour old
* Cache time can be changed in the Addons -> SpoddyCoiner menu, the maximum is 6 hours (21600 seconds)
* Cache can be cleared at any time in the Addons -> SpoddyCoiner menu
